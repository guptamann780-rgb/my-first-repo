 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.
 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education.

His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed.

The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick.

"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."

"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."

"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.

Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."

"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."

 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed.

November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.

Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories.

The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined.

Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope

	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."

"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."

We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.

"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light.

Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education.

His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed.

The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick.

"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."

"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."

"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.

Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."

"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."

 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed.

November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.

But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."

	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."

Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.
 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.

Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."

"With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.

"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."

 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed.

November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.

Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories.

The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.

Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined.

Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.

In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope

	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."

"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life. 
*****
Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."

We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.

"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light. She held a glass of water which she offered to Aparna, opened the curtains, and let the sunlight fill the room.
 Another bad dream?  asked Meena while rubbing her back with warm hands. Her mother, restless and always near, understood the pain of losing someone. She had experienced it when Aparna's father died when she was seven. Her brother had always been there to protect her, but Pragati's father reminded her of the void left by her own father.
In the last twelve days, Aparna remained in her room, refusing to socialize. She sat silently, sometimes waking in the midnight with nightmares, crying and sobbing until dawn. Each dream featured Pragati asking 'Why?' and Aparna unable to answer. Five nights out of twelve, she hadn't slept.
Vikram appointed a therapist, making the situation worse. In initial meetings, he probed into her experiences, but after two days, Aparna quit the therapy, saying,  I want to move on, but it was so gruesome that it stuck around. 
 Maybe my way can be helpful,  Meena said, smiling on her wrinkled face. She was old, closer to death, Aparna thought.  When your father died, I was traumatized and bewildered about how I would look after both of you. After a few days, I accepted what came to me. Yes,  Acceptance,  this is what you have to do. Maybe the reason behind Pragati s question was why you haven t accepted my death till now? Move on. 
Death is acceptable, but the cause of death kept Aparna pondering.  But what killed them? It wasn't natural, or thieves would not kill like this for just looting. When I asked my brother, he denied and said I need a little break. From then on, I've been leading this case, and you don t have to worry about anything.  Aparna gasped, her brows damp with sweat.
Meena brushed the sweat with the back of her hand and said,  Whatever it was, maybe thieves, psych killers, or a play of shadows in darkness. It shall be found in the investigation; our imagination is limitless.  Omens  are a good example of this. You tell me what are they? 
 An omen is something that happens or appears that is believed to be a sign of what will happen in the future, usually something good or bad. 
 And you know, omens are believed by men but never existed on their own.  She patted Aparna's back to excite and winked. Aparna noticed that her mom hadn t changed in these years. She had never noticed Vikram talking to her mother, and Meena explained it this way:  After Rajan s death, everything changed. 
Before leaving, Meena reminded her,  Tomorrow is the thirteenth day, there would be Tervi. It is believed that it is the last day of mourning, and after that, you continue your life with good memories of that person. I think you should visit there to mourn for the last time and continue with your normal life.

Late on the night of the fifth of November, after putting Aparna to bed, Vikram found himself engrossed in studying the cases from the past month. A cigarette steadily transformed into ashes, a testament to Vikram's excessive smoking on such nights. Files were strewn across the table, adorned with disturbing images of victims and a dearth of witnesses. Only three statements existed, yet they proved utterly futile.
Forensic reports, too, proved unhelpful, delving into the realm of animal behaviour in killings but failing to correlate them with any known species. Fingerprints and footprints offered no meaningful context. In light of all this, they expected him to keep everything concealed.
Amidst this perplexing scenario, Vikram received a call from Sakshi, someone he had been trying to contact since Pragati's demise. "Sakshi, Vikram here. It's been quite a while."
"It's been eight years. How's everything on your end?"
"I need you to take care of my sister. She witnessed her friend's murder twelve days ago and is grappling with trauma. She wanted to study abroad and I had denied but after this... I'll send her to you. A change in environment might do her good."
"Is she still talking to your mom?"
"Yes. It was fine until her friend's death, but now she's becoming more emotionally vulnerable." Vikram extinguished his cigarette and strolled to the veranda. "There have been twenty-six murders in the last month, all of them were exile cases. I hope you catch my drift."
"What can I do now? You've never told her the truth. If you don't want to reveal it, why not try manipulating her memories again?"
"I can't. I don't know the consequences. The last attempt was bearable. If she's with you, at least you can protect her."
"I think you're better suited for this task."
"I tried once..." Vikram sighed. "And I failed as a son. Promise me you'll handle her studies and therapy sessions. Don't worry about expenses."
"Alright, I'm on board. But what's happening with those murder cases? Why aren't they being solved?"
"Because there's an imminent threat to Varanasi. They're gearing up for a major attack, justifying their inability to solve those cases. It's their way of safeguarding the lives of seventeen lakh people on the expense of other lives."
"Take care of yourself and send me Aparna's documents. I'll apply for her university."
*****	
	Aparna found herself once again in front of the same pale yellow, two-storey house, this time under a clear blue sky, but she wasn't alone. People dressed in shades of white filled the surroundings. Inside the living room, furniture had been cleared away to make room for visitors to sit on mattresses spread across the floor. In the centre, an old man, Prakash Shah, Pragati's grandfather, performed the havan in front of three photos   Pragati and her parents. The room echoed with the chanting of the pandit and the lingering smell of sacred fire.
Taking her seat at the end of the room, Aparna observed as Prakash Shah, who lived elsewhere and visited sporadically, conducted the havan. After its conclusion, Aparna joined others in serving food to the visitors, and as dusk settled, only she and Prakash remained.
"Why isn't anyone else from your family here?" Aparna inquired, her gaze shifting uncomfortably between the smiling faces in the pictures.
"They're all busy, that's what they told me," Prakash replied, his eyes revealing a void that seemed to swallow the sorrow within.
"It's rude. At least one member should have come," Aparna expressed helplessly, unable to escape the penetrating gaze of Pragati's images.
"Tell me the truth, child," Prakash spoke, his stillness emphasizing his words. "I met your brother, and he explained everything about the case. When I was leaving, he said, 'Whatever happened that night was gruesome to the eyes and painful to the soul.' Tell me, is it true?"
"What I saw that night was terrible. It haunts my nights, and I don't want you to imagine your granddaughter like that. I think she should remain a beautiful child playing in your lap," Aparna shared, her eyes avoiding the emptiness in Prakash's gaze.
Tears welled in Prakash's eyes, threatening to spill onto his pale, wrinkled skin. He wiped them away with the back of his hand. "The last thing I remember before losing my vision was Vigya's death, my wife. Since then, I live alone, waiting for my death, but destiny had other plans."
"Perhaps you shouldn't remain alone. Come live with us. I'll talk to my brother," Aparna suggested, genuine concern in her voice.
"No need for that, child. I'm an old man, and I fear losing someone again. I prefer to remain alone now," he said with a slight smile. "I leave for Varanasi tomorrow. I have to immerse their ashes in the Ganga, follow the best practices for their salvation."
Liberating Pragati and her parents' souls seemed like a fitting tribute and a way to accept their tragic end. Aparna thought to herself, deciding to accompany him to Varanasi.

 It was a darker night than usual, with the moon absent from the sky to provide any guidance. Aparna Bhardwaj was en route to Pragati's house, her best friend since the third grade. They had both excelled in their higher secondary examinations, but this time, Pragati had also secured a scholarship for her foreign university education. Aparna, although her closest friend, didn't find it astonishing. She too longed to study abroad but knew she wouldn't obtain the necessary permission. Her brother had refused to sign the application form when she had asked him.
Pragati was leaving the next day, and this evening was her final dinner with her parents. She wanted to share it with her best friend. Aparna had spent most of her childhood at Pragati's house since they were neighbours. Aparna always cherished the company of Pragati's gentle and kind father, though she hadn't seen him in the four years since they had moved to their new house. A sense of loss overwhelmed her, not at the prospect of parting from Pragati, but from her father. Aparna understood that four years might not mean much to a man's growth, but they had transformed her into a woman, her long black hair flowing like strings of glistening black silk, reaching her waist. Her eyes radiated maturity rather than mischief, and she wondered how her father would react to the change.
Pragati's house lay nearly an hour away, on the outskirts of the city. The cab pulled into a lane, leaving the main road behind. Aparna gazed at the row of houses, each one evoking memories. In the moon's absence, they appeared lifeless. It wasn't as late as it seemed when the cab finally halted beside a two-story house. The nameplate read '42: Mr. and Mrs. Shah.' Aparna stepped out of the cab, struggling to balance three gifts piled on top of one another, gifts her mother had insisted on because it was her first visit in four years.
She surveyed the house; it was painted a pale yellow, barely visible in the darkness. The lights were off inside. Had there been a change of plans? Aparna wondered. She approached the doorbell, her fingers trembling. No one answered, and she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. An acrid odour made her head spin. She pushed the door open, revealing a narrow hallway with stairs leading up to the second floor, disappearing into darkness. The hallway had never seemed this long before. Aparna removed her sandals and placed them in the shoe rack by the entrance.
To the right was a common room, where guests were typically greeted. The foul smell intensified, but Aparna was drawn toward it, a sense of unease gnawing at her subconscious. She moved cautiously, trying to remain silent. With each step, the odour grew stronger, unpleasant but compelling her to continue. Just two steps from the room, she heard a faint sound, like someone chewing, coming from inside. It was strangely audible amidst the silence.
Taking a step closer, caution gripped her, and she refrained from rushing into the room. She pressed herself against the adjacent wall, clutching the gifts tightly. The smell continued to assault her senses, clouding her vision. With her last step towards the room, a chill ran down her spine as her foot met something damp and slick. She observed the liquid with a macabre curiosity, realizing it was a clear shade of blood, even in the darkness. The urge to scream welled up, but she managed to stifle it.
The dark, viscous pool beneath her foot seemed to come to life as she moved. It was cold and sent shivers up her spine as she continued to hear the chewing, growing rougher and more intense with each passing second. Aparna stood right outside the room, her back against the opposite wall. She turned her head slightly, glancing inside.
The room was shrouded in gloom, and Aparna struggled with her blurred vision and dizzy head. The arrangement of the furniture remained unchanged from four years ago, which helped her navigate in the darkness. It was a moderately sized room with a long rectangular window devoid of curtains. In one corner, an old television set stood, and a pair of sofas faced it in the centre. She searched for the source of the sound, and it seemed to emanate from behind one of the sofas, hidden in the shadows. She strained her eyes to get a glimpse of the figure.
Aparna decided to inch closer, her palms sweating profusely. Another sensation at her leg caught her attention, different from the wet strings she had imagined. They were Pragati's hair, strewn on the ground beside her, bathed in a pool of blood. Pragati lay lifeless, her hair cruelly torn from her scalp, blood oozing from the wound. One eye dangled grotesquely from a vein, while the other cheek had been savagely torn apart, revealing broken teeth and a shattered jaw. 
After that, Aparna's memory became a blur. She couldn't recall how she managed to leave the house, but suddenly she found herself running barefooted under the vast expanse of the night sky, leaving behind a trail of blood. Had whatever killed Pragati's family noticed me? She wondered as panic welled up inside her. Where had I left those gifts? If I had made too much noise, it might catch up to me. Aparna forcefully rejected the thought of looking back, tears streaming down her cheeks, her sole focus on finding a safe place to hide.
In the distance, she spotted a house with lights still on. She sprinted wildly towards it, rushing through the gate and slamming it shut behind her. Gasping for breath, hands on her knees, hair brushing against the ground.
Several footsteps approached her, and she realized there were four of them. Kavindra Purohit, a small man with piercing black eyes, was in the lead. His diminutive wife, with plump lips and sharp brown eyes, clutched one of their toddlers, while the other child hid behind him.
"Who are you?" Urvi, Mrs. Purohit, snapped, pressing her child protectively against her. Tension hung thick in the air.
"It was there... it killed them all... Pra... Pragati is... dead," Aparna choked out between sobs, her palms hiding her face. The stench of blood still clung to her, a cruel reminder of the horror she had witnessed. "A-all three of them... they're... they're dead."
Kavindra stepped closer, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Calm down. What happened? Is there a thief?" Urvi wanted to avoid her, but Kavindra silenced her with a gesture. "Can't you see how terrified she is? Get her a glass of water."
Urvi hurried off with both of her children, while Kavindra led Aparna to the drawing room. When Urvi returned alone, Aparna struggled with her glass, her senses recoiling. After a sip, she recounted the unsettling events at Pragati's house. Urvi, eavesdropping from a distance, showed little interest. Rising, Kavindra reassured Aparna, "Don't worry, we'll assist you."
"I'd like to call my brother; he's a police officer," Aparna suggested. "That way, no one is at risk."
"Sure, that's a good idea-"
"Oh dear, feel free to contact anyone. Let me fetch my phone for you," Urvi left with a warm smile. She subtly signalled Kavindra to join her.
Left alone in the room, Aparna grew restless. Something caught her attention at the corridor's end, where a couple argued.
"How can we let her stay here? What if it drags us in? You should ask her to leave."
"Trust me, nothing's going to happen. She's just talking nonsense. She's just a child; with the police, it'll be straightforward."
"What if she's a fraud, making all this up? Calling her brother might be a ploy."
It would be Seventh murder in their colony within a month, every crime was brutal and inhumane. Every single person of that colony remained beware of that and avoid entertaining any stranger. Their day ends with the last trace of sunset. 
Urvi spotted Aparna and halted. Aparna crossed, her leg throbbing with every step. To her surprise, both children were wide awake, their unease evident.
 I must do this, or they won't help or trust me. Aparna thought. Gathering courage, she declared, "You can call the police yourself; that should suffice my innocence, I though. We need to turn off all the lights and stay vigilant for any activity, it may come here too. Trust me, I've lost my uncle, aunt, and my best friend " at this her lips tightened words turned into grief and the hideous face of Pragati flashed in front of her before collapsing to the floor.
Aparna lay on the sofa, slowly regaining consciousness in the dimly lit room. Her memory was a blur, and she had no idea how much time had passed. The silence was broken by a persistent knocking at the door, which had likely jolted her awake. Suddenly, all her memories came flooding back, and fear gripped her tightly. She cautiously made her way to the corridor, where she expected to find the others, but there was no one in sight. 
"Where is everyone?" she whispered to herself, puzzled by the emptiness. As she took a step toward the door, something abruptly yanked her back. It was Kavindra's hand, holding a rod, with his wife right behind him.
"Who's there?" Kavindra shouted, keeping a safe distance from the door.
The knocking ceased, and a voice responded, "I'm Saurabh Gupta, a police sub-inspector. You reported a murder in your neighbour's house."
Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief as the lights flickered on, and they welcomed the officer. Saurabh was of average build, with a dark complexion and short, slightly curled hair.
"You have nothing to worry about; we've secured the house. When we arrived, there was no one inside," Saurabh assured them, leaving out the grim details of the three lifeless bodies he had discovered. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Aparna, knowing how deeply this ordeal had affected her. "Can you please tell me your name, young lady?"
"I'm Aparna Bhardwaj," she replied.
"Vikram Bhardwaj is your brother," he asserted confidently. "If so, I'd like to mention that you both possess identical almond-shaped black eyes."
This revelation was accurate; she and Vikram indeed shared these distinct eyes, an inherited feature from their father. It left her simultaneously comforted and mystified. Saurabh detected this mixed emotion on her face and explained that he and her brother had received their training at the same academy and remained close friends.
*****
When the police arrived, the scene sprang back to life. Reluctant spectators gathered to witness yet another gruesome murder   the seventh in just a month according to those ignorant observers. The police team ensured that no one left the site, as the bodies had already been placed inside the ambulance, and the forensic team meticulously scoured for additional clues. The crowd outside the house consisted solely of adults with sombre faces, not a place suitable for children.
Amidst the low murmurs and suppressed gossip, emotions played across the faces of the onlookers. Vikram, leaning against the ambulance, observed it all while taking a drag from his cigarette, wondering if Pragati was as bothered by his smoking as Aparna was. He discreetly flicked the cigarette away upon seeing Aparna, but the lingering smell remained.
Aparna approached him, barefoot and with her clothes already ruined. She clung to him tightly, like a ten-year-old seeking solace by burying her head in his chest, tears streaming down her face. He comforted her and escorted her to their car, assigning a constable to watch over her. Then, he headed back to the house, following Saurabh.
An unpleasant yet potent odour assailed their senses as they entered the house. The bodies were gone, but blood still stained the floor. Vikram noticed gifts strewn about, marred by splotches of blood. Saurabh broke the silence, saying, "I'm really sorry for your loss; they were close to you," as he made his way toward a room. Vikram silently trailed behind.
Saurabh paused and repeated, "Sorry," and Vikram, standing aside, reminded him, "You've already said that."
"I can't keep track of how many apologies I've offered for the deaths of people's loved ones in just a month," Saurabh admitted, his words lacking genuine emotion. "Now it feels like I'm just saying empty words."
Saurabh turned to Vikram and suggested, "I think you should check on her. She's probably struggling to process all of this."
Vikram glanced towards the room, where officers were busy collecting samples for forensics. "She seems fine, I think," he said. "How many deaths have occurred this month?"
"Twenty-six," Saurabh replied, his words heavy with anger and grief. "All of them the same   cruel, gruesome, and grotesque."
Vikram, trying to make sense of the situation, asked, "With this many deaths, it's surprising that people aren't in a state of panic. It's nothing short of a wonder."
Saurabh shared a grim secret, "This false peace is maintained through constant fear. Our DGP had a search operation in the nearby forests last week, and it ended with four more deaths added to the list. Then he lied, saying it's the work of a band of thieves, so until they get caught, people should remain cautious at night. But I caution you not to share this with anyone; all of this falls under 'Exiled' cases."
As they both made their way out of the house to get some fresh air, Vikram inquired, "What do you plan to do with this case?"
Saurabh, taking long strides with an unnatural pace, replied, "Just like those twenty-three cases before it, attach the reports, file the descriptions   something I can't stand doing   and forward it as an exiled case."
"I would suggest you avoid a post-mortem in this case," Vikram proposed with little hope
"I can't help you," Saurabh said, looking at the crowd, and Vikram noticed the desolate look in his eyes. "I am resigning."
Vikram's eyes widened; he didn't expect it from him. "Why?"
"It haunts me every night. I fear for my family, and I believe it would be better to remain close to them." After a pause, he continued, "You might be thinking, 'how a person like me, who values rules and discipline the most, suddenly left those things behind?' But deaths taught me the value of life. I can't imagine it happening to anyone I know; it is just so inhumane."
Vikram was disappointed. He wanted Aparna out of this case, and the only hope was his friend, but it felt impossible to bring Saurabh back in. "Then don't worry. I am going to handle this case." It came to him in an instant. Vikram observed his sister silently sitting inside the car. This step was necessary to get her out of it. As far as she remains all of this is good. "With your resignation, you are going to recommend me tomorrow, to bring justice to such deaths I have to do this." A lie again in exchange for surety, same as DGP.
"It amazes me, Vikram, you are so calm after all of this. Your former neighbours have been murdered, your sister was a few steps away from death itself, and she is safe now but traumatized. What made you so insensitive?"
"You have mistaken it for calmness. My emotions have faded long ago, even before joining the police. Now, only my fam ily and duty matter to me." Vikram realized he mentioned his family before his duty.
*****
In the oppressive gloom, distant droplets echoed ominously, casting ripples that crawled toward Aparna's feet in a pool of coagulated blood stretching to the edge of the abyss. The desolation was palpable beneath an obsidian sky bereft of life. She stood alone, able to move but unable to escape the macabre reality.
A looming silhouette materialized in the shadows, inching closer with each blink. Pragati's grotesque figure emerged, and Aparna recoiled from the ghastly voice that emanated. "Why, Aparna?" The disfigured spectre confronted her, prompting Aparna to turn away, eyes clenched shut. When she dared to open them, she found herself facing Pragati's feet submerged in a pool of crimson. Tracing the trail of blood, Aparna recoiled at the grotesque sight above Pragati's elbow.
Teeth cascaded into the abyss; each disappearance more rapid than the last. Aparna's gaze rose, and a nauseating horror gripped her as Pragati's shattered jaw attempted speech. Teeth fell like withered leaves, and an eye dangled through a vein in her ravaged cheek. Her head swelled, blood coursing down, severing her face into grotesque halves.
"Help us," Pragati implored, tears of blood streaming. A deep voice, politely sinister, joined the chorus. Uncle emerged, a towering figure, blood-soaked and adorned with a deceitful grin. His face was bearable, yet his protruding ribs resembled broken ivory serpents, and torn stomach flesh sagged with intestinal snakes. Dizziness overwhelmed Aparna; she crumpled to her knees, the realization haunting her that they could decipher her thoughts.
Don't look, you are alone. They are dead a desperate inner voice pleaded. But defiance came in the form of two hands cupping Aparna's cheeks. The cold touch, infused with blood, startled her. Aunt's face surfaced, a mask of twisted benevolence. "You're not alone, and we're not dead," she whispered with a malevolent smile.
Aparna's scream shattered the nightmarish tableau. As she awoke, reality rushed in, dispelling the grotesque illusion. It marked the seventh occurrence. November fifth, twelve days since Pragati's demise. A slender figure, Aparna's mother, appeared, her face etched with concern, round eyes widening in the dim light.
